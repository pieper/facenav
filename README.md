# FaceNav

An experiment in image based face tracking to support
neurosurgical navigation.

This code experiments with the idea of using a
Azure Kinect device (circa 2020) to localize
a human face and spatially register it to a
CT or MRI scan coordinate system.

The code is posted here for reference and further study.

## Built with

* 3D Slicer
* Azure Kinect SDK (and device)
